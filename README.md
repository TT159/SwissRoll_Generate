# SwissRoll_Generate
This is the project to generate some Swiss Roll datasets. <\br>

When I wanted to search for some swiss-roll data sets for machine learning on the Internet, I found that there were relatively few resources in this area, and it was difficult to find the appropriate source code to generate the corresponding data sets. Thus, I write the MatLab code to generate some kinds of swiss-roll. I hope this can help youã€‚ </br>
