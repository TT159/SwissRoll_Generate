# SwissRoll_Generate
This is the project to generate some Swiss Roll datasets. </br>

When I wanted to search for some swiss-roll data sets with labels for machine learning on the Internet, I found that there were relatively few resources in this area, and it was difficult to find the appropriate source code to generate the corresponding data sets. Thus, I write the MatLab code to generate some kinds of swiss-roll. I hope this can help you.</br>   

# Swiss Rolls dataset
> The Swiss Rolls dataset is, itself, not very interesting. It is simply a standard "hello world" 3 dimensional data set which is universally known among academics working on various topics of dimensionality reduction techniques and algorithms.

In my project, I focus on both 2 and 4 classes labeled data sets. In addition, I generate two different kinds of swiss roll data set. The one is derived from the classical swiss roll data set in which the data is generated uniformly.
